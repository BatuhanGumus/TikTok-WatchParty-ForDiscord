## Features
You will find 2 components of this project.
1) [Discord Bot](/DiscordBot)
    - Keeps the TikToks sent and gives them to you via JSON.
2) [Browser Extension](/BrowserExtension)
    - Allows you to go through the sent TikToks with ease.
    - See the comment the person made with the TikTok they sent.
    - Randomize the list in case a person sent too many back to back.
    - Can hide who sent it if you want to guess.


## Get Things Running
### Discord Bot
1) Go through [Discord documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started) for setting up a bot on your server.
2) Put in your bot token in the [config.json](/DiscordBot/config.json) file.
    ```json
    {
        "token": "your-token-goes-here"
    }
    ```
3) Run the bot with `node index.js` and keep it open. The bot will react with a "üëç" to any message that starts with a TikTok link and save it.

5) `//check` will get the bot to text to that text channel with who sent how many TikToks and `//checkpoint` will also attatch a JSON file and clear the bot memory.
    ```
    ======================================
    User1 has sent 38 TikToks
    User2 has sent 25 TikToks
    User3 has sent 51 TikToks
    Total of 114 TikToks
    ======================================
    ```

### Browser Extension
1) Go through [Google documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) for installing custom extensions.
2) Download the JSON from the Discord bots message. In the extension menu open this extension and find the JSON you downloaded to innitiate.

3) The bot will open TikTok and you will find a small panel on the left to go through all the TikToks that were sent.
